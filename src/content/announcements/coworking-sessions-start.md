Several people have wished to have some more regular times to sit together and ask questions when they get stuck packaging. 
So we made some time slots available.

This Weekend Sunday: 18:00 CET we will have the first session. I know this might not fit everyone but with it repeating 
every week there is hopefully enough slots where people can bring issues they are having. If other times are needed we can also add them.
